RSA Factoring Challenge

We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents.
It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers.
Your mission should you choose to accept it to factorize these numbers as fast as possible
before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decodethe encrypted documents.
